# parklife.dev

This is the website for [Parklife](https://github.com/benpickles/parklife), a Ruby library that renders a Rack app to a static build. It's also an example of a Parklife/Sinatra static app and uses [Decant](https://github.com/benpickles/decant) for frontmatter-aware access to a directory of Markdown documents.

## Development

```sh
bundle install
```

To start the local web server:

```sh
bin/dev
```
